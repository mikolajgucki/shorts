## `recall@k` & `precision@k`


A relevant item means a good recommendation to a user (an item with rating above 3.5 or an item the user clicked/interacted with).

```
recall@k =
  (# of recommended items @k that are relevant) /
  (total # of relevant items)
```

```
precision@k =
  (# of recommended items @k that are relevant) / 
  (# of recommended items @k)
```
